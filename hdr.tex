\section{The explicit isogeny problem}

An isogeny is a non-constant algebraic map between elliptic curves,
preserving the point at infinity. %
An isogeny is also a surjective group morphism of elliptic curves. %
It turns out these definitions are equivalent, but, before getting
these pages drenched in more properties and theorems, let's have a
look at an example.

The map $φ$ from the elliptic curve $y^2=x^3+x$ to $y^2=x^3-4x$
defined by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:isog-example}
  \begin{aligned}
    φ(x,y) &= \left(\frac{x^2+1}{x},y\frac{x^2-1}{x^2}\right),\\
    φ(\O) &= \O
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
is an isogeny. %
As an algebraic map it has degree $2$, which implies that it is a
two-to-one map, as it can be inferred from the polynomial degrees. %
Our rational maps are not defined at $x=0$, but this expression should
really be understood as the projective map
\begin{equation*}
  φ(X:Y:Z) = (X(X^2+Z^2):Y(X^2-Z^2):ZX^2),
\end{equation*}
showing that the only other point in $\ker φ$, besides $\O$, is
$(0:0:1)$.

What does an isogeny ``look like''? %
Drawing the above one in $\R^2$ would look rather messy, but an
isogeny defined over the rationals is still an isogeny if we reduce
modulo a prime $p$. %
Figure~\ref{fig:isog-example} plots the action of the
isogeny~\eqref{eq:isog-example} on the image of the curves in
$\F_{11}$. %
We observe a symmetry with respect to the $x$-axis, a consequence of
the fact that $φ$ is a group morphism; and by looking closer we may
also notice that colinear points are sent to colinear points, also a
necessity for a group morphism. %
Something strikes us, though: the map looks by no means surjective! %
This is because, when we think of isogenies, we think of them as
geometric objects, acting on the extension of the curves to the
algebraic closure. %
This is not dissimilar from the way power-by-$n$ maps act on the
multiplicative group $k^\times$ of a field $k$: the map $x↦x^2$, for
example, is a two-to-one map on $\F_{11}$, and those elements that
have no antecedents, the non-squares, will have exactly two in
$\F_{11^2}$, and so on. %
In much the same way, in an algebraic closure $\bar{\F}_{11}$ of
$\F_{11}$, the isogeny $φ$ becomes surjective and every point gains
exactly two antecedents. %
This analogy is more profound that it may seem, and shall bear its
fruits in Chapter~\ref{cha:fpbar}.
