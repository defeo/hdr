  abstract             = {We present new candidates for quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems based on the conjectured difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the two parties to arrive at a common shared key despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring. Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumption along with a discussion of its validity. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves.},

  abstract  = {An isogeny between elliptic curves is an algebraic morphism which is a group homomorphism. Many applications in cryptography require evaluating large degree isogenies between elliptic curves efficiently. For ordinary curves of the same endomorphism ring, the previous best known algorithm has a worst case running time which is exponential in the length of the input. In this paper we show this problem can be solved in subexponential time under reasonable heuristics. Our approach is based on factoring the ideal corresponding to the kernel of the isogeny, modulo principal ideals, into a product of smaller prime ideals for which the isogenies can be computed directly. Combined with previous work of Bostan et al., our algorithm yields equations for large degree isogenies in quasi-optimal time given only the starting curve and the kernel.},

The problem seems to be hard for solving with a quantum computer. {ElGamal} public-key encryption and {Diffie-Hellman} key agreement are proposed for an isogeny cryptosystem. The paper describes theoretical background and a public-key encryption technique, followed by security analysis and consideration of cryptosystem parameters selection.

This is followed by a detailed study of elliptic curves with complex multiplication, their associated Gr\"{o}ssencharacters and L-series, and applications to the construction of abelian extensions of quadratic imaginary fields. Next comes a treatment of elliptic curves over function fields and elliptic surfaces, including specialization theorems for heights and sections. This material serves as a prelude to the theory of minimal models and N\'{e}ron models of elliptic curves, with a discussion of special fibers, conductors, and Ogg's formula. Next comes a brief description of q-models for elliptic curves over C and R, followed by Tate's theory of q-models for elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant over p-adic fields. The book concludes with the construction of canonical local height functions on elliptic curves, including explicit formulas for both archimedean and non-archimedean fields.}},

Tate's isogeny theorem states that there is an isogeny from E1 to E2 which is defined over Fp. The goal of this paper is to describe a probabilistic algorithm for constructing such an {isogeny.The} algorithm proposed in this paper has exponential complexity in the worst case. Nevertheless, it is efficient in certain situations (that is, when the class number of the endomorphism ring is small). The significance of these results to elliptic curve cryptography is discussed.},

  abstract  = {The braid groups are infinite non-commutative groups naturally arising from geometric braids. The aim of this article is twofold. One is to show that the braid groups can serve as a good source to enrich cryptography. The feature that makes the braid groups useful to cryptography includes the followings: (i) The word problem is solved via a fast algorithm which computes the canonical form which can be efficiently manipulated by computers. (ii) The group operations can be performed efficiently. (iii) The braid groups have many mathematically hard problems that can be utilized to design cryptographic primitives. The other is to propose and implement a new key agreement scheme and public key cryptosystem based on these primitives in the braid groups. The efficiency of our systems is demonstrated by their speed and information rate. The security of our systems is based on topological, combinatorial and group-theoretical problems that are intractible according to our current mathematical knowledge. The foundation of our systems is quite different from widely used cryptosystems based on number theory, but there are some similarities in design.},

We give an improvement of this algorithm by modifying the pseudorandom walk so that lower-degree isogenies are used more frequently. This is motivated by the fact that high degree isogenies are slower to compute than low degree ones. We analyse the running time of the parallel collision search algorithm when the partitioning is uneven. We also give experimental results. We conclude that our algorithm is around                                                                           {\$}{\$}14{\$}{\$}                 times faster than the GHS algorithm when constructing horizontal isogenies between random isogenous elliptic curves over a                                                                           {\$}{\$}160{\$}{\$}                -bit prime field.

The curve Es is used just as usual in elliptic curve cryptosystems. The curve Es is submitted to a trusted authority for the purpose of key escrow. The crucial difference from other key escrow scenarios is that the trusted authority has to invest a considerable amount of computation to compromise a user's private key, which makes applications such as widespread wire-tapping impossible.},

DHIES is a Diffie-Hellman based scheme that combines a symmetric encryption method, a message authentication code, and a hash function, in addition to number-theoretic operations, in a way which is intended to provide security against chosen-ciphertext attacks. In this paper we find natural assumptions under which DHIES achieves security under chosen-ciphertext attack. The assumptions we make about the Diffie-Hellman problem are interesting variants of the customary ones, and we investigate relationships among them, and provide security lower bounds. Our proofs are in the standard model; no random-oracle assumption is required.},
