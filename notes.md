### Research summary

#### Plan 1: Crypto ← Isogeny graphs → finite fields

- Explain the "local point of view" given by the action of π on
  E[ℓ]. Link to point counting and other applications.

- Explain how to "climb to the global view" by looking at the action
  of π on T_ℓ. Link to ANTS paper.
	  → Justification for towers of finite fields.
	  → Isogeny graphs and crypto.
