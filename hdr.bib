For hyper elliptic curves of genus g over Fq we show that the number of rational points on the curve and the number of rational points on its Jacobian can be computed in ({q)O}(g2g)time.},

The formula lends itself to a simple and compact algorithm that can efficiently compute any low odd-degree isogenies inside the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange protocol.

A recent paper by Azarderakhsh, Jao, Kalach, Koziel and Leonardi showed that the public keys defined in Jao and De Feo's original SIDH scheme can be further compressed by around a factor of two, but reported that the performance penalty in utilizing this compression blew the overall SIDH runtime out by more than an order of magnitude. Given that the runtime of SIDH key exchange is currently its main drawback in relation to its lattice- and code-based post-quantum alternatives, an order of magnitude performance penalty for a factor of two improvement in bandwidth presents a trade-off that is unlikely to favor public-key compression in many scenarios.},

Schoof \ref[Math.

This is done for enough small primes \$l\$. <P> In a series of unpublished manuscripts, Atkin providedmany improvements that made this algorithm practical.Atkin used the modular equation \$E\_l(X,Y)\$ of \$X\_0(l)\$. The decomposition of thepolynomial \$E\_l(X,j)\in {\bold F}\_p[X]\$ provides some information about \$t\bmod l\$ if\$j\$ is the modular invariant of the elliptic curve.Atkin developed efficient techniquesfor computing nice modular equations (nicer than \$E\_l(X,Y)\$)and was able to efficiently implementthe resulting algorithm.<P> Further improvements were proposed by the author.

The discrete logarithm problem can therefore be solved using index calculus algorithms as long as k is small. In the elliptic curve case it was shown by Menezes, Okamoto and Vanstone that for supersingular curves one has k ⪯ 6. In this paper curves of higher genus are studied. Bounds on the possible values for k in the case of supersingular curves are given which imply that supersingular curves are weaker than the general case for cryptography. Ways to ensure that a curve is not supersingular are also discussed. A constructive application of supersingular curves to cryptography is given, by generalising an identity-based cryptosystem due to Boneh and Franklin. The generalised scheme provides a significant reduction in bandwidth compared with the original scheme.},

We analyse the running time of the parallel collision search algorithm when the partitioning is uneven. We also give experimental results.

The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the two parties to arrive at a common shared key despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring. Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumption along with a discussion of its validity. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves.},

  abstract  = {An isogeny between elliptic curves is an algebraic morphism which is a group homomorphism. Many applications in cryptography require evaluating large degree isogenies between elliptic curves efficiently. For ordinary curves of the same endomorphism ring, the previous best known algorithm has a worst case running time which is exponential in the length of the input. In this paper we show this problem can be solved in subexponential time under reasonable heuristics. Our approach is based on factoring the ideal corresponding to the kernel of the isogeny, modulo principal ideals, into a product of smaller prime ideals for which the isogenies can be computed directly. Combined with previous work of Bostan et al., our algorithm yields equations for large degree isogenies in quasi-optimal time given only the starting curve and the kernel.},

This attacking scenario is well understood in the cryptographic community. However, there are many protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem that turn out to leak many of the secret key bits from this oracle attack, unless suitable checkings are carried out. In this paper we present a key recovery attack on various discrete log-based schemes working in a prime order subgroup. Our attack may reveal part of, or the whole secret key in most Diffie-Hellman-type key exchange protocols and some applications of ElGamal encryption and signature schemes.},

Schoof showed that for an elliptic curve \$E\$ over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$, given by a Weierstrass equation, one can compute the number of \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$-rational points of \$E\$ in time \$O((\log q)^9)\$. Our result is the following. Let \$A\$ be an Abelian variety over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$. Then one can compute the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism of \$A\$ in time \$O((\log q)^\Delta)\$, where \$\Delta\$ and the implied constant depend only on the dimension of the embedding space of \$A\$, the number of equations defining \$A\$ and the addition law, and their degrees. The method, generalizing that of Schoof, is to use the machinery developed by Weil to prove the Riemann hypothesis for Abelian varieties. By means of this theory, the calculation is reduced to ideal-theoretic computations in a ring of polynomials in several variables over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$. As applications we show how to count the rational points on the reductions modulo primes \$p\$ of a fixed curve over \$\mathbf {Q}\$ in time polynomial in \$\log p\$; we show also that, for a fixed prime \$l\$, we can compute the \$l\$th roots of unity \$\operatorname{mod} p\$, when they exist, in polynomial time in \$\log p\$. This generalizes Schoof's application of his algorithm to find square roots of a fixed integer \$x \operatorname{mod} p\$.},

In this system, a pair (Es, Epb) of elliptic curves over F2161 is constructed with the following properties: (i) the {Gaudry-Hess}-Smart Weil descent attack reduces the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem ({ECDLP}) in {Es(F2161}) to a hyperelliptic curve {DLP} in the Jacobian of a curve of genus 7 or 8, which is computationally feasible, but by far not trivial; (ii) Es is isogenous to Es; (iii) the best attack on the {ECDLP} in {Es(F2161}) is the parallelized Pollard rho method. The curve Es is used just as usual in elliptic curve cryptosystems. The curve Es is submitted to a trusted authority for the purpose of key escrow. The crucial difference from other key escrow scenarios is that the trusted authority has to invest a considerable amount of computation to compromise a user's private key, which makes applications such as widespread wire-tapping impossible.},

The running time of the algorithm is onthe order of \$g^{4+\epsilon}n^{3+\epsilon}\$, where \$n\$ is the degreeof the finite field and \$g\$ is the genus of the curve (assuming thatthe curve has a rational Weierstrass point).},

However, we only prove the correctness of this algorithm when the field characteristic is at least 5. The algorithm is based upon a cohomological formula for the L -function of an additive character sum. One consequence is a practical method of finding the order of the group of rational points on the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve in characteristic 2.},

For an odd prime p not dividing the discriminant of Q, let Zp(T) denote the zeta function of the hyperelliptic curve of genus g over the finite field Fp obtained by reducing the coefficients of the equation y2 = Q(x) modulo p. We present an explicit deterministic algorithm that given as input Q and a positive integer N, computes Zp(T) simultaneously for all such primes p < N, whose average complexity per prime is polynomial in g, log N, and the number of bits required to represent Q.},
