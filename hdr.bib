The formula lends itself to a simple and compact algorithm that can efficiently compute any low odd-degree isogenies inside the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange protocol. Our implementation of this algorithm shows that, beyond the commonly used 3-isogenies, there is a moderate degradation in relative performance of                                                                                   {\$}{\$}(2d+1){\$}{\$}                                                                                            (                          2                          d                          +                          1                          )                                                                                    -isogenies as d grows, but that larger values of d can now be used in practical SIDH implementations.},

A recent paper by Azarderakhsh, Jao, Kalach, Koziel and Leonardi showed that the public keys defined in Jao and De Feo's original SIDH scheme can be further compressed by around a factor of two, but reported that the performance penalty in utilizing this compression blew the overall SIDH runtime out by more than an order of magnitude. Given that the runtime of SIDH key exchange is currently its main drawback in relation to its lattice- and code-based post-quantum alternatives, an order of magnitude performance penalty for a factor of two improvement in bandwidth presents a trade-off that is unlikely to favor public-key compression in many scenarios.},

In this paper we discuss the differences between them and run some comparative experiments.

The decomposition of thepolynomial \$E\_l(X,j)\in {\bold F}\_p[X]\$ provides some information about \$t\bmod l\$ if\$j\$ is the modular invariant of the elliptic curve.Atkin developed efficient techniquesfor computing nice modular equations (nicer than \$E\_l(X,Y)\$)and was able to efficiently implementthe resulting algorithm.<P> Further improvements were proposed by the author. He showed that for one \$l\$ over two (namely when the Frobeniusaction on the \$l\$-torsion splits) there is a much faster wayto compute the residue modulo \$l\$ of the trace \$t\$.<P> A nice survey paper on these questions is that of Schoof\ref[J.

In the elliptic curve case it was shown by Menezes, Okamoto and Vanstone that for supersingular curves one has k ‚™Ø 6. In this paper curves of higher genus are studied. Bounds on the possible values for k in the case of supersingular curves are given which imply that supersingular curves are weaker than the general case for cryptography. Ways to ensure that a curve is not supersingular are also discussed. A constructive application of supersingular curves to cryptography is given, by generalising an identity-based cryptosystem due to Boneh and Franklin. The generalised scheme provides a significant reduction in bandwidth compared with the original scheme.},

The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the two parties to arrive at a common shared key despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring. Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumption along with a discussion of its validity. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves.},

  abstract  = {An isogeny between elliptic curves is an algebraic morphism which is a group homomorphism. Many applications in cryptography require evaluating large degree isogenies between elliptic curves efficiently. For ordinary curves of the same endomorphism ring, the previous best known algorithm has a worst case running time which is exponential in the length of the input. In this paper we show this problem can be solved in subexponential time under reasonable heuristics. Our approach is based on factoring the ideal corresponding to the kernel of the isogeny, modulo principal ideals, into a product of smaller prime ideals for which the isogenies can be computed directly. Combined with previous work of Bostan et al., our algorithm yields equations for large degree isogenies in quasi-optimal time given only the starting curve and the kernel.},

This attacking scenario is well understood in the cryptographic community. However, there are many protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem that turn out to leak many of the secret key bits from this oracle attack, unless suitable checkings are carried out. In this paper we present a key recovery attack on various discrete log-based schemes working in a prime order subgroup. Our attack may reveal part of, or the whole secret key in most Diffie-Hellman-type key exchange protocols and some applications of ElGamal encryption and signature schemes.},

As a particular case, we provide efficient formulas for 2-isogenies between Montgomery curves and show that these formulas can be used in isogeny-based cryptosystems without expensive square root computations and without knowledge of a special point of order 8.

Next comes a treatment of elliptic curves over function fields and elliptic surfaces, including specialization theorems for heights and sections. This material serves as a prelude to the theory of minimal models and N\'{e}ron models of elliptic curves, with a discussion of special fibers, conductors, and Ogg's formula. Next comes a brief description of q-models for elliptic curves over C and R, followed by Tate's theory of q-models for elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant over p-adic fields. The book concludes with the construction of canonical local height functions on elliptic curves, including explicit formulas for both archimedean and non-archimedean fields.}},

In this system, a pair (Es, Epb) of elliptic curves over F2161 is constructed with the following properties: (i) the {Gaudry-Hess}-Smart Weil descent attack reduces the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem ({ECDLP}) in {Es(F2161}) to a hyperelliptic curve {DLP} in the Jacobian of a curve of genus 7 or 8, which is computationally feasible, but by far not trivial; (ii) Es is isogenous to Es; (iii) the best attack on the {ECDLP} in {Es(F2161}) is the parallelized Pollard rho method. The curve Es is used just as usual in elliptic curve cryptosystems. The curve Es is submitted to a trusted authority for the purpose of key escrow. The crucial difference from other key escrow scenarios is that the trusted authority has to invest a considerable amount of computation to compromise a user's private key, which makes applications such as widespread wire-tapping impossible.},

Schoof showed that for an elliptic curve \$E\$ over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$, given by a Weierstrass equation, one can compute the number of \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$-rational points of \$E\$ in time \$O((\log q)^9)\$. Our result is the following. Let \$A\$ be an Abelian variety over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$. Then one can compute the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism of \$A\$ in time \$O((\log q)^\Delta)\$, where \$\Delta\$ and the implied constant depend only on the dimension of the embedding space of \$A\$, the number of equations defining \$A\$ and the addition law, and their degrees. The method, generalizing that of Schoof, is to use the machinery developed by Weil to prove the Riemann hypothesis for Abelian varieties. By means of this theory, the calculation is reduced to ideal-theoretic computations in a ring of polynomials in several variables over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$. As applications we show how to count the rational points on the reductions modulo primes \$p\$ of a fixed curve over \$\mathbf {Q}\$ in time polynomial in \$\log p\$; we show also that, for a fixed prime \$l\$, we can compute the \$l\$th roots of unity \$\operatorname{mod} p\$, when they exist, in polynomial time in \$\log p\$. This generalizes Schoof's application of his algorithm to find square roots of a fixed integer \$x \operatorname{mod} p\$.},

  abstract             = {We present two algorithms to compute the endomorphism ring of an ordinary elliptic curve E defined over a finite field . Under suitable heuristic assumptions, both have subexponential complexity. We bound the complexity of the first algorithm in terms of , while our bound for the second algorithm depends primarily on {log|DE}|, where {DE} is the discriminant of the order isomorphic to {End(E}). As a byproduct, our method yields a short certificate that may be used to verify that the endomorphism ring is as claimed.},

Two prominent examples are Jao-De Feo's key exchange protocol and the resulting encryption scheme by De Feo-Jao-Pl{\^u}t. One particularity of the isogeny problems underlying these protocols is that some additional information is given as input, namely the image of some torsion points with order coprime to the isogeny. This additional information was used in several active attacks against the protocols but the current best passive attacks make no use of it at all.},

DHIES is a Diffie-Hellman based scheme that combines a symmetric encryption method, a message authentication code, and a hash function, in addition to number-theoretic operations, in a way which is intended to provide security against chosen-ciphertext attacks. In this paper we find natural assumptions under which DHIES achieves security under chosen-ciphertext attack. The assumptions we make about the Diffie-Hellman problem are interesting variants of the customary ones, and we investigate relationships among them, and provide security lower bounds. Our proofs are in the standard model; no random-oracle assumption is required.},

  abstract  = {Supersingular isogeny-based cryptography is one of the more recent families of post-quantum proposals. An interesting feature is the comparatively low bandwidth occupation in key agreement protocols, which stems from the possibility of key compression. However, compression and decompression introduce a significant overhead to the overall processing cost despite recent progress. In this paper we address the main processing bottlenecks involved in key compression and decompression, and suggest substantial improvements for each of them. Some of our techniques may have an independent interest for other, more conventional areas of elliptic curve cryptography as well.},

This is useful for computations in the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key-exchange protocol which is one of the more recent contenders in the post-quantum public-key arena. One of the main computational bottlenecks in this cryptographic key-exchange protocol is computing modular arithmetic in a finite field defined by a prime of this special shape. Recent implementations already use this special prime shape to speed up the cryptographic implementations but it remains unclear if the choices made are optimal or if one can do better. Our overview shows that in the SIDH setting, where arithmetic over a quadratic extension field is required, the approaches based on Montgomery multiplication are to be preferred. Based on our results, we give selection criteria for such moduli and the outcome of our search reveals that there exist moduli which result in even faster implementations.},

As examples, we investigate two specific families of optimal expander graphs for provable collision resistant hash function constructions: the families of Ramanujan graphs constructed by {Lubotzky-Phillips}-Sarnak and Pizer respectively. When the hash function is constructed from one of Pizer's Ramanujan graphs, (the set of supersingular elliptic curves over with ‚Ñì-isogenies, ‚Ñì a prime different from¬†p), then collision resistance follows from hardness of computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. For the {LPS} graphs, the underlying hard problem is a representation problem in group theory. Constructing our hash functions from optimal expander graphs implies that the outputs closely approximate the uniform distribution. This property is useful for arguing that the output is indistinguishable from random sequences of bits. We estimate the cost per bit to compute these hash functions, and we implement our hash function for several members of the Pizer and {LPS} graph families and give actual timings.},

We follow the definition used in {MMM95} and basically due to Kronecker for solving zero-dimensional systems: A system is solved if each root is represented in such way as to allow the performance of any arithmetical operations over the arithmetical expressions of its coordinates. We propose new definitions for solving zero-dimensional systems in this sense by introducing the Univariate Representation of their roots. We show by this way that the solutions of any zero-dimensional system of polynomials can be expressed through a special kind of univariate representation (Rational Univariate Representation): where (f,g,g 1, ‚Ä¶,g n ) are polynomials of {K[X} 1, ‚Ä¶, X n ]. A special feature of our Rational Univariate Representation is that we dont loose geometrical information contained in the initial system. Moreover we propose different efficient algorithms for the computation of the Rational Univariate Representation, and we make a comparison with standard known tools.},

By a suitable extension of fast univariate Euclidean division, we obtain theoretical and practical improvements over a direct recursive approach; for a family of special cases, we reach quasi-linear complexity. The main outcome we have in mind is the acceleration of higher-level algorithms, by interfacing our low-level implementation with languages such as {AXIOM} or Maple We show the potential for huge speed-ups, by comparing two {AXIOM} implementations of van Hoeij and Monagan's modular {GCD} algorithm.},

  abstract             = {Given a system of polynomial equations and inequations with coefficients in the field of rational numbers, we show how to compute a geometric resolution of the set of common roots of the system over the field of complex numbers. A geometric resolution consists of a primitive element of the algebraic extension defined by the set of roots, its minimal polynomial, and the parametrizations of the coordinates. Such a representation of the solutions has a long history which goes back to Leopold Kronecker and has been revisited many times in computer algebra. We introduce a new generation of probabilistic algorithms where all the computations use only univariate or bivariate polynomials. We give a new codification of the set of solutions of a positive dimensional algebraic variety relying on a new global version of Newton's iterator. Roughly speaking the complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in some kind of degree of the system, in its height, and linear in the complexity of evaluation of the system. We present our implementation in the Magma system which is called Kronecker in homage to his method for solving systems of polynomial equations. We show that the theoretical complexity of our algorithm is well reflected in practice and we exhibit some cases for which our program is more efficient than the other available software.},

The original motivation for  writing the book was an attempt to understand the relation between the theories of transfinite numbers and  mathematical games. By defining numbers as the strengths of positions in certain games, the author  arrives at a new class, the surreal numbers (so named by Donald Knuth) that includes at the same time the  real numbers and the ordinal numbers.   <P>This new edition ends with an epilogue that sets the stage for further research on surreal numbers. The  book is a must-have for all readers with a serious interest in the mathematical foundations of game  strategies.}},

We revisit Rabin's (1980) algorithm providing a variant of it that improves Rabin's cost estimate by a log n factor. We give a precise analysis of the probability that a random polynomial of degree n contains no irreducible factors of degree less than O(log n). This probability is naturally related to Ben-Or's (1981) algorithm for testing irreducibility of polynomials over finite fields. We also compute the probability of a polynomial being irreducible when it has no irreducible factors of low degree. This probability is useful in the analysis of various algorithms for factoring polynomials over finite fields. We present an experimental comparison of these irreducibility methods when testing random polynomials.},

Further, let Œì = Œì(q) denote the algebraic closure of GF(q) so that every polynomial in GF[q,x] on which there is defined a binary considers certain sets of monic polynomials from GF[q,x] on which there is defined a binary operation called the composed product. Here, if f and g are monics in GF[q,x] with deg f = m and deg g=n, then the composed product, denoted by f‚ô¶g and defined in terms of the roots of f and g, is also in GF[q,x] and has degree mn. In the present paper, the two most important composed products, denoted by the special symbols ≈å and ‚àó, are those induced by the field multiplication and the field addition on Œì and defined by: f‚àòg = Œ† Œ†Œ±Œ≤ (x ‚àí Œ±Œ≤), f‚àóg = Œ† Œ†Œ±Œ≤ (x ‚àí (Œ±+Œ≤)), where the products indicated by –ü are the usual products in Œì[x] and are taken over all the roots Œ± of f and Œ≤ of g, (including multiplicities). These two composed products are called composed multiplication and composed addition, respectively. After introducing and developing some theory concerning a more general notion of composed product, this paper moves to the special composed products above and asks whether the irreducibles over GF(q) can be factored uniquely into indecomposables with respect to each of these products. Here, the term ‚Äúirreducible‚Äù is used in the usual sense of the word while the term ‚Äúindecomposable‚Äù is used in reference to composed products. This question is shown to have an affirmative answer in both situations, and thus yield unique factorization theorems (multiplicative and additive) for Œì. These theorems are then used to prove corresponding unique factorization theorems for all subfields of Œì. Next, it is shown that there are no irreducibles f in GF[q,x] which can be decomposed as f=f1OÃÑg1=f2‚àóg2 (except for trivial decompositions). A special inversion formula is then derived and using this inversion formula, the authors determine the numbers of irreducibles of degree n which are indecomposable with respect to (i) composed multiplication ≈å, (ii) composed addition ‚àó, and (iii) both the composed products ≈å and ‚àó simultaneously. These numbers are given in terms of the well-known number of irreducibles of degree n over GF(q). A final section contains some discussion and several observations about the more general composed product.},

We demonstrate that the new baby step/giant step factoring method, recently developed by Kaltofen and Shoup, can be made into a very practical algorithm. We describe an implementation of this algorithm, and present the results of empirical tests comparing this new algorithm with others. When factoring polynomials modulo large primes, the algorithm allows much larger polynomials to be factored using a reasonable amount of time and space than was previously possible. For example, this new software has been used to factor a #generic# polynomial of degree 2048 modulo a 2048-bit prime in under 12 days on a Sun SPARC-station 10, using 68 MB of main memory.},

Assuming that the multiplicative structure of the algebra A is (partly) known, we address the question of speeding up the linear algebra phase for the computation of minimal polynomials and rational parametrizations in A. We present new formul{\ae} for the rational parametrizations, extending those of Rouillier, and algorithms extending ideas introduced by Shoup in the univariate case. Our approach is based on the A-module structure of the dual space \$\widehat{A}\$ . An important feature of our algorithms is that we do not require \$\widehat{A}\$ to be free and of rank 1. The complexity of our algorithms for computing the minimal polynomial and the rational parametrizations are O(2 nD 5/2) and O( n2 nD 5/2) respectively, where D is the dimension of A. For fixed n, this is better than algorithms based on linear algebra except when the complexity of the available matrix product has exponent less than 5/2.},
