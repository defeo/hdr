                   been extensively studied over recent years. Previous

                   the case of â-isogenies whose kernels are defined
                   by a rational subgroup. In particular, the height of

  abstract =      {We give a generalization to Abelian varieties over
                   finite fields of the algorithm of Schoof for elliptic
                   curves. Schoof showed that for an elliptic curve
                   \$E\$ over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$, given by a Weierstrass
                   equation, one can compute the number of
                   \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$-rational points of \$E\$ in time
                   \$O((\log q)^9)\$. Our result is the following. Let
                   \$A\$ be an Abelian variety over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$.
                   Then one can compute the characteristic polynomial of
                   the Frobenius endomorphism of \$A\$ in time \$O((\log
                   q)^\Delta)\$, where \$\Delta\$ and the implied
                   constant depend only on the dimension of the
                   embedding space of \$A\$, the number of equations
                   defining \$A\$ and the addition law, and their
                   degrees. The method, generalizing that of Schoof, is
                   to use the machinery developed by Weil to prove the
                   Riemann hypothesis for Abelian varieties. By means of
                   this theory, the calculation is reduced to
                   ideal-theoretic computations in a ring of polynomials
                   in several variables over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$. As
                   applications we show how to count the rational points
                   on the reductions modulo primes \$p\$ of a fixed
                   curve over \$\mathbf {Q}\$ in time polynomial in
                   \$\log p\$; we show also that, for a fixed prime
                   \$l\$, we can compute the \$l\$th roots of unity
                   \$\operatorname{mod} p\$, when they exist, in
                   polynomial time in \$\log p\$. This generalizes
                   Schoof's application of his algorithm to find square
                   roots of a fixed integer \$x \operatorname{mod} p\$.},

  abstract =      {In this paper we focus on tests and constructions of
                   irreducible polynomials over finite fields. We
                   revisit Rabin's (1980) algorithm providing a variant
                   of it that improves Rabin's cost estimate by a log n
                   factor. We give a precise analysis of the probability
                   that a random polynomial of degree n contains no
                   irreducible factors of degree less than O(log n).
                   This probability is naturally related to Ben-Or's
                   (1981) algorithm for testing irreducibility of
                   polynomials over finite fields. We also compute the
                   probability of a polynomial being irreducible when it
                   has no irreducible factors of low degree. This
                   probability is useful in the analysis of various
                   algorithms for factoring polynomials over finite
                   fields. We present an experimental comparison of
                   these irreducibility methods when testing random
                   polynomials.},

                   Representation of their roots. We show by this way
                   that the solutions of any zero-dimensional system of
                   polynomials can be expressed through a special kind
                   of univariate representation (Rational Univariate
                   Representation): where (f,g,g 1, â¦,g n ) are
                   polynomials of {K[X} 1, â¦, X n ]. A special feature
                   of our Rational Univariate Representation is that we
                   dont loose geometrical information contained in the
                   initial system. Moreover we propose different
                   efficient algorithms for the computation of the
                   Rational Univariate Representation, and we make a
                   comparison with standard known tools.},

                   inequations with coefficients in the field of
                   rational numbers, we show how to compute a geometric
                   resolution of the set of common roots of the system
                   over the field of complex numbers. A geometric
                   resolution consists of a primitive element of the
                   algebraic extension defined by the set of roots, its
                   minimal polynomial, and the parametrizations of the
                   coordinates. Such a representation of the solutions
                   has a long history which goes back to Leopold
                   Kronecker and has been revisited many times in
                   computer algebra. We introduce a new generation of
                   probabilistic algorithms where all the computations
                   use only univariate or bivariate polynomials. We give
                   a new codification of the set of solutions of a
                   positive dimensional algebraic variety relying on a
                   new global version of Newton's iterator. Roughly
                   speaking the complexity of our algorithm is
                   polynomial in some kind of degree of the system, in
                   its height, and linear in the complexity of
                   evaluation of the system. We present our
                   implementation in the Magma system which is called
                   Kronecker in homage to his method for solving systems
                   of polynomial equations. We show that the theoretical
                   complexity of our algorithm is well reflected in
                   practice and we exhibit some cases for which our
                   program is more efficient than the other available

                   book was an attempt to understand the relation
                   between the theories of transfinite numbers and
                   mathematical games. By defining numbers as the
                   strengths of positions in certain games, the author
                   arrives at a new class, the surreal numbers (so named
                   by Donald Knuth) that includes at the same time the
                   real numbers and the ordinal numbers. <P>This new
                   edition ends with an epilogue that sets the stage for
                   further research on surreal numbers. The book is a

  abstract =      {Let GF(q) denote the finite field of q elements and
                   let GF[q,x] denote the integral domain of polynomials
                   in an indeterminate x over GF(q). Further, let Î =
                   Î(q) denote the algebraic closure of GF(q) so that
                   every polynomial in GF[q,x] on which there is defined
                   a binary considers certain sets of monic polynomials
                   from GF[q,x] on which there is defined a binary
                   operation called the composed product. Here, if f and
                   g are monics in GF[q,x] with deg f = m and deg g=n,
                   then the composed product, denoted by fâ¦g and
                   defined in terms of the roots of f and g, is also in
                   GF[q,x] and has degree mn. In the present paper, the
                   two most important composed products, denoted by the
                   special symbols Å and â, are those induced by the
                   field multiplication and the field addition on Î and
                   defined by: fâg = Î  Î Î±Î² (x â Î±Î²), fâg =
                   Î  Î Î±Î² (x â (Î±+Î²)), where the products
                   indicated by Ð are the usual products in Î[x] and
                   are taken over all the roots Î± of f and Î² of g,
                   (including multiplicities). These two composed
                   products are called composed multiplication and
                   composed addition, respectively. After introducing
                   and developing some theory concerning a more general
                   notion of composed product, this paper moves to the
                   special composed products above and asks whether the
                   irreducibles over GF(q) can be factored uniquely into
                   indecomposables with respect to each of these
                   products. Here, the term âirreducibleâ is used in
                   the usual sense of the word while the term
                   âindecomposableâ is used in reference to composed
                   products. This question is shown to have an
                   affirmative answer in both situations, and thus yield
                   unique factorization theorems (multiplicative and
                   additive) for Î. These theorems are then used to
                   prove corresponding unique factorization theorems for
                   all subfields of Î. Next, it is shown that there are
                   no irreducibles f in GF[q,x] which can be decomposed
                   as f=f1OÌg1=f2âg2 (except for trivial
                   decompositions). A special inversion formula is then
                   derived and using this inversion formula, the authors
                   determine the numbers of irreducibles of degree n
                   which are indecomposable with respect to (i) composed
                   multiplication Å, (ii) composed addition â, and
                   (iii) both the composed products Å and â
                   simultaneously. These numbers are given in terms of
                   the well-known number of irreducibles of degree n
                   over GF(q). A final section contains some discussion
                   and several observations about the more general
                   composed product.},

                   by Shoup in the univariate case. Our approach is
                   based on the A-module structure of the dual space
                   \$\widehat{A}\$ . An important feature of our
                   algorithms is that we do not require \$\widehat{A}\$
                   to be free and of rank 1. The complexity of our
                   algorithms for computing the minimal polynomial and
                   the rational parametrizations are O(2 nD 5/2) and O(
                   n2 nD 5/2) respectively, where D is the dimension of
                   A. For fixed n, this is better than algorithms based
                   on linear algebra except when the complexity of the
                   available matrix product has exponent less than 5/2.},

                   in several draft standards. DHIES is a Diffie-Hellman
                   based scheme that combines a symmetric encryption
                   method, a message authentication code, and a hash

                   find natural assumptions under which DHIES achieves

                   collision resistant hash functions from expander
                   graphs in which finding cycles is hard. As examples,
                   we investigate two specific families of optimal
                   expander graphs for provable collision resistant hash
                   function constructions: the families of Ramanujan
                   graphs constructed by {Lubotzky-Phillips}-Sarnak and
                   Pizer respectively. When the hash function is
                   constructed from one of Pizer's Ramanujan graphs,
                   (the set of supersingular elliptic curves over with
                   â-isogenies, â a prime different fromÂ p), then
                   collision resistance follows from hardness of
                   computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic
                   curves. For the {LPS} graphs, the underlying hard
                   problem is a representation problem in group theory.
                   Constructing our hash functions from optimal expander
                   graphs implies that the outputs closely approximate
                   the uniform distribution. This property is useful for
                   arguing that the output is indistinguishable from
                   random sequences of bits. We estimate the cost per
                   bit to compute these hash functions, and we implement
                   our hash function for several members of the Pizer
                   and {LPS} graph families and give actual timings.},

                   well-understood for elliptic curves, but not for
                   higher-dimensional abelian varieties. We study the
                   case of absolutely simple ordinary abelian varieties
                   over a finite field. We analyse graphs of so-called
                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathfrak l{\$}{\$} l -isogenies,
                   resolving that, in arbitrary dimension, their
                   structure is similar, but not identical, to the
                   ``volcanoes'' occurring as graphs of isogenies of
                   elliptic curves. Specializing to the case of
                   principally polarizable abelian surfaces, we then
                   exploit this structure to describe graphs of a
                   particular class of isogenies known as
                   {\$}{\$}({\backslash}ell , {\backslash}ell ){\$}{\$}

                   Weil pairing. We use these two results to write an

                   an arbitrary absolutely simple ordinary abelian
                   surface towards one with maximal endomorphism ring,
                   which has immediate consequences for the CM-method in
                   genus 2, for computing explicit isogenies, and for
                   the random self-reducibility of the discrete

                   solvable automorphism group, then the equation {f(X})
                   = 0 can be solved by radicals. The first step of the

                   self-contained account of Algebraic Complexity Theory

                   the reader only some basic algebra and offering over
                   350 exercises, it is well-suited as a textbook for
                   beginners at graduate level. With its extensive
                   bibliography covering about 500 research papers, this
                   text is also an ideal reference book for the
                   professional researcher. The subdivision of the
                   contents into 21 more or less independent chapters
                   enables readers to familiarize themselves quickly
                   with a specific topic, and facilitates the use of
                   this book as a basis for complementary courses in

                   Introduction We consider the problem of factoring a
                   univariate polynomial over a finite field. This
                   problem plays a central role in computational
                   algebra. Indeed, many of the efficient algorithms for
                   factoring univariate and multivariate polynomials
                   over finite fields, the field of rational numbers,
                   and finite extensions of the rationals solve as a
                   subproblem the problem of factoring univariate
                   polynomials over finite fields (Kaltofen 1990). This
                   problem also has important applications in number
                   theory (Buchmann 1990), coding theory (Berlekamp
                   1968), and ...},

  abstract =      {In recent years, the discovery of new algorithms for
                   dealing with polynomial equations, coupled with their
                   implementation on fast inexpensive computers, has
                   sparked a minor revolution in the study and practice
                   of algebraic geometry. These algorithmic methods have
                   also given rise to some exciting new applications of
                   algebraic geometry. This book illustrates the many
                   uses of algebraic geometry, highlighting some of the
                   more recent applications of Gr\"{o}bner bases and
                   resultants. In order to do this, the authors provide
                   an introduction to some algebraic objects and
                   techniques which are more advanced than one typically
                   encounters in a first course, but nonetheless of
                   great utility. The book is written for nonspecialists
                   and for readers with a diverse range of backgrounds.
                   It assumes knowledge of the material covered in a
                   standard undergraduate course in abstract algebra,
                   and it would help to have some previous exposure to
                   Gr\"{o}bner bases. The book does not assume the
                   reader is familiar with more advanced concepts such
                   as modules. For this new edition the authors added
                   two new sections and a new chapter, updated the
                   references and made numerous minor improvements
                   throughout the text.},

  abstract  = {Since 1974, several algorithms have been developed
                   that attempt to factor a large number \$N\$ by doing
                   extensive computations modulo \$N\$ and occasionally
                   taking {GCDs} with \$N\$. These began with Pollard's
                   \$p - 1\$ and Monte Carlo methods. More recently,
                   Williams published a \$p + 1\$ method, and Lenstra
                   discovered an elliptic curve method ({ECM}). We
                   present ways to speed all of these. One improvement
                   uses two tables during the second phases of \$p \pm
                   1\$ and {ECM}, looking for a match. Polynomial
                   preconditioning lets us search a fixed table of size
                   \$n\$ with \$n/2 + o(n)\$ multiplications. A
                   parametrization of elliptic curves lets Step 1 of
                   {ECM} compute the \$x\$-coordinate of \${nP}\$ from
                   that of \$P\$ in about \$9.3 \log\_2 n\$
                   multiplications for arbitrary \$P\$.},

                   and practical questions in the area of elliptic
                   curves and class field theory. The dissertation has
                   two main parts, as described below. Let O be an
                   imaginary quadratic order of discriminant D < 0, and
                   let K = â Q( D). The class polynomial HD of O is
                   the polynomial whose roots are precisely the
                   j-invariants of elliptic curves with complex
                   multiplication by O. Computing this polynomial is
                   useful in constructing elliptic curves suitable for
                   cryptography, as well as in the context of explicit
                   class field theory. In the first part of the
                   dissertation, we present an algorithm to compute HD
                   p-adically where p is a prime inert in K and not
                   dividing D. Ì This involves computing the canonical
                   lift E of a pair (E, f ) where E is a supersingular
                   elliptic curve and f is an embedding of O into the
                   endomorphism ring of E. We also present an algorithm
                   to compute HD modulo p for p inert which is used in
                   the Chinese remainder theorem algorithm to compute HD
                   . For an elliptic curve E over any field K, the Weil
                   pairing en is a bilinear map on the points of order n
                   of E. The Weil pairing is a useful tool in both the
                   theory of elliptic curves and the application of
                   elliptic curves to cryptography. However, for K of
                   characteristic p, the classical Weil pairing on the
                   points of order p is trivial. In the second part of
                   the dissertation, we consider E over the dual numbers
                   K[ ] and define a non-degenerate â Weil pairing on
                   p-torsion.â We show that this pairing satisfies
                   many of the same properties of the classical pairing.
                   Moreover, we show that it directly relates to recent
                   attacks on the discrete logarithm problem on the
                   p-torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the
                   finite field Fq . We also present a new attack on the
                   discrete logarithm problem on anomalous curves using
                   a lift of E over Fp [ ].},

                   attempts to build identification protocols that do
                   not rely on arithmetical operations with large
                   numbers but only use simple operations (see [ 10 , 8
                   ]). One was presented at the CRYPTO 89 rump session
                   ([ 8 ]) and depends on the so-called Permuted Kernel
                   problem (PKP). Another appeared in the CRYPTO 93
                   proceedings and is based on the syndrome decoding
                   problem (SD) form the theory of error correcting
                   codes ([ 11 ]). In this paper, we introduce a new
                   scheme of the same family with the distinctive
                   character that both the secret key and the public
                   identification key can be taken to be of short
                   length. By short, we basically mean the usual size of
                   conventional symmetric cryptosystems. As is known,
                   the possibility of using short keys has been a
                   challenge in public key cryptography and has
                   practical applications. Our scheme relies on a
                   combinatorial problem which we call Constrained
                   Linear Equations (CLE in short) and which consists of
                   solving a set of linear equations modulo some small
                   prime q , the unknowns being subject to belong to a
                   specific subset of the integers mod q . Thus, we
                   enlarge the set of tools that can be used in
                   cryptography.},

                   Their practical significance was soon demonstrated in
                   the work of Fiat and Shamir ([ 4 ]), who turned
                   zero-knowledge proofs of quadratic residuosity into
                   efficient means of establishing user identities.
                   Still, as is almost always the case in public-key
                   cryptography, the Fiat-Shamir scheme relied on
                   arithmetic operations on large numbers. In 1989,
                   there were two attempts to build identification
                   protocols that only use simple operations (see [ 11 ,
                   10 ]). One appeared in the EUROCRYPT proceedings and
                   relies on the intractability of some coding problems,

                   not really practical. In the present paper, we
                   propose a new identification scheme, based on
                   error-correcting codes, which is zero-knowledge and
                   is of practical value. Furthermore, we describe
                   several variants, including one which has an identity
                   based character. The security of our scheme depends
                   on the hardness of decoding a word of given syndrome
                   w.r.t. some binary linear error-correcting code.},

                   interactive identification schemes have been proposed
                   (in particular Fiat-Shamir [ 2 ] and its variants [ 8
                   , 5 , 4 ], Schnorr [ 9 ]). These identifications are
                   based on number theoretical prob- lems. More
                   recently, new schemes appeared with the peculiarity
                   that they are more efficient from the computational
                   point of view and that their security is based on NP
                   -complete problems: PKP (Permuted Ker- nels Problem)

                   new NP -complete linear problem which comes from
                   learn- ing machines: the Perceptrons Problem. We have
                   some constraints, m vectors X i of {â1, +1} n , and

                   proofs of assertions to interactive proofs of
                   knowledge. This leads to the definition of
                   unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge
                   in which the prover demonstrates possession of
                   knowledge without revealing any computational
                   information whatsoever (not even the one bit revealed
                   in zero-knowledge proofs of assertions). We show the
                   relevance of these notions to identification schemes,
                   in which parties prove their identity by
                   demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving
                   the validity of assertions. We describe a novel
                   scheme which is provably secure if factoring is
                   difficult and whose practical implementations are
                   about two orders of magnitude faster than RSA-based
                   identification schemes. The advantages of thinking in
                   terms of proofs of knowledge rather than proofs of
                   assertions are demonstrated in two efficient variants
                   of the scheme: unrestricted input zero-knowledge
                   proofs of knowledge are used in the construction of a
                   scheme which needs no directory; a version of the
                   scheme based on parallel interactive proofs (which
                   are not known to be zero knowledge) is proved secure

  title =         {New Public-Key Cryptosystem Using Braid Groups},
  year =          {2000},
  abstract =      {The braid groups are infinite non-commutative groups
                   naturally arising from geometric braids. The aim of
                   this article is twofold. One is to show that the
                   braid groups can serve as a good source to enrich
                   cryptography. The feature that makes the braid groups
                   useful to cryptography includes the followings: (i)
                   The word problem is solved via a fast algorithm which
                   computes the canonical form which can be efficiently
                   manipulated by computers. (ii) The group operations
                   can be performed efficiently. (iii) The braid groups
                   have many mathematically hard problems that can be
                   utilized to design cryptographic primitives. The
                   other is to propose and implement a new key agreement
                   scheme and public key cryptosystem based on these
                   primitives in the braid groups. The efficiency of our
                   systems is demonstrated by their speed and
                   information rate. The security of our systems is
                   based on topological, combinatorial and
                   group-theoretical problems that are intractible
                   according to our current mathematical knowledge. The
                   foundation of our systems is quite different from
                   widely used cryptosystems based on number theory, but
                   there are some similarities in design.},

                   The book begins with the theory of elliptic and
                   modular functions for the full modular group r(1),
                   including a discussion of Hekcke operators and the
                   L-series associated to cusp forms. This is followed
                   by a detailed study of elliptic curves with complex
                   multiplication, their associated
                   Gr\"{o}ssencharacters and L-series, and applications
                   to the construction of abelian extensions of
                   quadratic imaginary fields. Next comes a treatment of
                   elliptic curves over function fields and elliptic
                   surfaces, including specialization theorems for
                   heights and sections. This material serves as a
                   prelude to the theory of minimal models and N\'{e}ron
                   models of elliptic curves, with a discussion of
                   special fibers, conductors, and Ogg's formula. Next
                   comes a brief description of q-models for elliptic
                   curves over C and R, followed by Tate's theory of
                   q-models for elliptic curves with non-integral
                   j-invariant over p-adic fields. The book concludes
                   with the construction of canonical local height
                   functions on elliptic curves, including explicit
                   formulas for both archimedean and non-archimedean
                   fields.}},

                   those class groups.Based on heuristic reasoning, we
                   give advice for selecting the cryptographic
                   parameter, i.e. the discriminant, such that
                   cryptosystems based on class groups of imaginary
                   quadratic orders would offer a similar security as
                   commonly used cryptosystems.},

  abstract =      {Consider the well-known oracle attack: somehow one
                   gets a certain computation result as a function of a
                   secret key from the secret key owner and tries to
                   extract some information on the secret key. This
                   attacking scenario is well understood in the
                   cryptographic community. However, there are many
                   protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem
                   that turn out to leak many of the secret key bits
                   from this oracle attack, unless suitable checkings
                   are carried out. In this paper we present a key
                   recovery attack on various discrete log-based schemes
                   working in a prime order subgroup. Our attack may
                   reveal part of, or the whole secret key in most
                   Diffie-Hellman-type key exchange protocols and some
                   applications of ElGamal encryption and signature
                   schemes.},
