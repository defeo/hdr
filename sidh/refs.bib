@article{montgomery,
    abstract = {Since 1974, several algorithms have been developed that attempt to factor a large number \$N\$ by doing extensive computations modulo \$N\$ and occasionally taking {GCDs} with \$N\$. These began with Pollard's \$p - 1\$ and Monte Carlo methods. More recently, Williams published a \$p + 1\$ method, and Lenstra discovered an elliptic curve method ({ECM}). We present ways to speed all of these. One improvement uses two tables during the second phases of \$p \pm 1\$ and {ECM}, looking for a match. Polynomial preconditioning lets us search a fixed table of size \$n\$ with \$n/2 + o(n)\$ multiplications. A parametrization of elliptic curves lets Step 1 of {ECM} compute the \$x\$-coordinate of \${nP}\$ from that of \$P\$ in about \$9.3 \log\_2 n\$ multiplications for arbitrary \$P\$.},

In particular when k =2, we show a tight bound of the quantum query complexity for the Claw Finding problem, improving previous upper and lower bounds by Buhrman, Durr, Heiligman, Hoyer, Magniez, Santha and de Wolf [7]. We also consider the distributed scenario, where two parties each holds an n -element set, and they want to decide whether the two sets share a common element. We show a family of protocols s . t . q ( P ) 3/2 . c ( P )= O ( n 2 log n ), where q ( P ) and c ( P ) are the number of quantum queries and the number of communication qubits that the protocol P makes, respectively. This implies that we can pay more for quantum queries to save on quantum communication, and vice versa. To our knowledge, it is the first result about the tradeoff between the two resources.}},

One was presented at the CRYPTO 89 rump session ([ 8 ]) and depends on the so-called Permuted Kernel problem (PKP). Another appeared in the CRYPTO 93 proceedings and is based on the syndrome decoding problem (SD) form the theory of error correcting codes ([ 11 ]). In this paper, we introduce a new scheme of the same family with the distinctive character that both the secret key and the public identification key can be taken to be of short length. By short, we basically mean the usual size of conventional symmetric cryptosystems. As is known, the possibility of using short keys has been a challenge in public key cryptography and has practical applications. Our scheme relies on a combinatorial problem which we call Constrained Linear Equations (CLE in short) and which consists of solving a set of linear equations modulo some small prime q , the unknowns being subject to belong to a specific subset of the integers mod q . Thus, we enlarge the set of tools that can be used in cryptography.},

    abstract = {Zero-knowledge proofs were introduced in 1985, in a paper by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff ([ 6 ]). Their practical significance was soon demonstrated in the work of Fiat and Shamir ([ 4 ]), who turned zero-knowledge proofs of quadratic residuosity into efficient means of establishing user identities. Still, as is almost always the case in public-key cryptography, the Fiat-Shamir scheme relied on arithmetic operations on large numbers. In 1989, there were two attempts to build identification protocols that only use simple operations (see [ 11 , 10 ]). One appeared in the EUROCRYPT proceedings and relies on the intractability of some coding problems, the other was presented at the CRYPTO rump session and depends on the so-called Permuted Kernel problem (PKP). Unfortunately, the first of the schemes was not really practical. In the present paper, we propose a new identification scheme, based on error-correcting codes, which is zero-knowledge and is of practical value. Furthermore, we describe several variants, including one which has an identity based character. The security of our scheme depends on the hardness of decoding a word of given syndrome w.r.t. some binary linear error-correcting code.},

Since zero-know- ledge theory appeared [ 3 ], several interactive identification schemes have been proposed (in particular Fiat-Shamir [ 2 ] and its variants [ 8 , 5 , 4 ], Schnorr [ 9 ]). These identifications are based on number theoretical prob- lems. More recently, new schemes appeared with the peculiarity that they are more efficient from the computational point of view and that their security is based on NP -complete problems: PKP (Permuted Ker- nels Problem) [ 10 ], SD (Syndrome Decoding) [ 12 ] and CLE (Constrained Linear Equations) [ 13 ]. We present a new NP -complete linear problem which comes from learn- ing machines: the Perceptrons Problem. We have some constraints, m vectors X i of {−1, +1} n , and we want to find a vector V of {−1, +1} n such that X i · V ≥ 0 for all i . Next, we provide some zero-knowledge interactive identification protocols based on this problem, with an evaluation of their security. Eventually, those protocols are well suited for smart card applications.},

    abstract = {In this paper we extend the notion of interactive proofs of assertions to interactive proofs of knowledge. This leads to the definition of unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge in which the prover demonstrates possession of knowledge without revealing any computational information whatsoever (not even the one bit revealed in zero-knowledge proofs of assertions). We show the relevance of these notions to identification schemes, in which parties prove their identity by demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving the validity of assertions. We describe a novel scheme which is provably secure if factoring is difficult and whose practical implementations are about two orders of magnitude faster than RSA-based identification schemes. The advantages of thinking in terms of proofs of knowledge rather than proofs of assertions are demonstrated in two efficient variants of the scheme: unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are used in the construction of a scheme which needs no directory; a version of the scheme based on parallel interactive proofs (which are not known to be zero knowledge) is proved secure by observing that the identification protocols are proofs of knowledge.},

    abstract = {In this paper we describe simple identification and signature schemes which enable any user to prove his identity and the authenticity of his messages to any other user without shared or public keys. The schemes are provably secure against any known or chosen message attack if factoring is difficult, and typical implementations require only 1\% to 4\% of the number of modular multiplications required by the RSA scheme. Due to their simplicity, security and speed, these schemes are ideally suited for microprocessor-based devices such as smart cards, personal computers, and remote control systems.},

@inproceedings{shamir89-pkp,
    abstract = {In 1985 Goldwasser Micali and Rackoff proposed a new type of interactive proof system which reveals no knowledge whatsoever about the assertion except its validity. The practical significance of these proofs was demonstrated in 1986 by Fiat and Shamir, who showed how to use efficient zero knowledge proofs of quadratic residuosity to establish user identities and to digitally sign messages. In this paper we propose a new zero knowledge identification scheme, which is even faster than the Fiat-Shamir scheme, using a small number of communicated bits, simple 8-bit arithmetic operations, and compact public and private keys. The security of the new scheme depends on an NP-complete algebraic problem rather than on factoring, and thus it widens the basis of public key cryptography, which has become dangerously dependent on the difficulty of a single problem.},

@phdthesis{belding08-thesis,
    abstract = {We present new algorithms related to both theoretical and practical questions in
the area of elliptic curves and class field theory. The dissertation has two main parts, as
described below.
Let O be an imaginary quadratic order of discriminant D < 0, and let K =
√
Q( D). The class polynomial HD of O is the polynomial whose roots are precisely
the j-invariants of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by O. Computing this
polynomial is useful in constructing elliptic curves suitable for cryptography, as well as
in the context of explicit class field theory. In the first part of the dissertation, we present
an algorithm to compute HD p-adically where p is a prime inert in K and not dividing D.
 ̃
This involves computing the canonical lift E of a pair (E, f ) where E is a supersingular
elliptic curve and f is an embedding of O into the endomorphism ring of E. We also
present an algorithm to compute HD modulo p for p inert which is used in the Chinese
remainder theorem algorithm to compute HD .
For an elliptic curve E over any field K, the Weil pairing en is a bilinear map on the
points of order n of E. The Weil pairing is a useful tool in both the theory of elliptic curves
and the application of elliptic curves to cryptography. However, for K of characteristic
p, the classical Weil pairing on the points of order p is trivial. In the second part of the
dissertation, we consider E over the dual numbers K[ ] and define a non-degenerate  ” Weil
pairing on p-torsion.” We show that this pairing satisfies many of the same properties of
the classical pairing. Moreover, we show that it directly relates to recent attacks on the
discrete logarithm problem on the p-torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the finite
field Fq . We also present a new attack on the discrete logarithm problem on anomalous
curves using a lift of E over Fp [ ].},
